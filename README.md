# Movcol6

Movcol6 is a set of routines for simulating solutions of sixth order PDEs, specifically ones that develop singularities or other hard-to-resolve features.

Included for convenience is the DASPK package by Petzold et. al. availble directly [here](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~cse/software.html).
